## Description

[NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) Boilerplate made with ❤️ by [💡VivifyIdeas💡](https://www.vivifyideas.com).

## Description

## setup and running the app

Just run the `init` script:
```bash
$ ./init
```
It will setup the project for you (building the Docker images, starting docker-compose stack, running typerom schema:sync).
The NestJs app running in dev mode will be exposed on `http://localhost:80`.

For IDE autocompletion to work, run `yarn` on the host machine.


## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test

# e2e tests
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:cov
```

## Environment Configuration

Integrated Configuration Module so you can just inject `ConfigService`
and read all environment variables from `.env` file, which is created automatically by the init script from `.env.example`.

## Swagger

RESTful APIs you can describe with already integrated Swagger.
To see all available endpoints visit http://localhost:80/api/docs

## TypeORM integrated

[TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/) gives you possibility to use next db types:
`mysql`, `postgres`, `mariadb`, `sqlite`, etc. Please look at docs for more details.
The `docker-compose` template uses `mariadb`, which is setup in `ormconfig.js`.

## Authentication - JWT

Already preconfigured JWT authentication.
It's suggested to change current password hashing to something more secure.
You can start use already working implementation of `Login` and `Registration`
endpoints, just take a look at [http://localhost:80/api/docs](http://localhost:80/api/docs).
