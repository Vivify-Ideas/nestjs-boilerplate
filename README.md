## Description

[NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) Boilerplate made with ❤️ by [💡VivifyIdeas💡](https://www.vivifyideas.com).

## Start Guide

### Outside Docker containers

- Create .env file `cp .env.example .env` and replace existing env variables
  (mysql/mariadb connection params)
- Install dependencies `yarn`
- Start the app `yarn start` (app will be exposed through the port 3000)

### Inside Docker containers

Just run already prepared bash script:
```bash
$ ./init
```
It will setup the project for you (starting docker-compose stack, running migrations).
The NestJS app running in dev mode will be exposed on `http://localhost` (port 80)

For IDE autocompletion to work, run `yarn` on the host machine.

## Prisma integrated

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) Prisma helps app developers build faster and
make fewer errors with an open source ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. 
Please look at docs for more details.
The `docker-compose` template uses `PostgresSQL`.

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test

# e2e tests
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:cov
```

## Environment Configuration

Integrated Configuration Module so you can just inject `ConfigService`
and read all environment variables from `.env` file, which is created automatically by the init script from `.env.example`.

## Swagger

RESTful APIs you can describe with already integrated Swagger.
To see all available endpoints visit http://localhost/api/docs

## Authentication - JWT

Already preconfigured JWT authentication.
It's suggested to change current password hashing to something more secure.
You can start use already working implementation of `Login` and `Registration`
endpoints, just take a look at [http://localhost/api/docs](http://localhost/api/docs).
